# DeviantCoding.

DeviantCoding aims to group a set of opinionated components sharing a common code style and build tools.

## Registerly

This is the first and, for now, only component using the framework. 

It started as an improvement on [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor)'s handling of attributes for self-registration and 
depended on Scrutor itself, but has evolved into a complete replacement for most scenarios.

You can access the [Registerly documentation](https://manuel-fernandez-rodriguez.github.io/DeviantCoding/docs/registerly/introduction.html) and give it a try.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed, even if they're only in the form of a well documented feature request, they help immensely to
make any component better.

Please, see the [guidelines on contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
