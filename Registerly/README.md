# Registerly

Registerly started as an improvement on [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor)'s handling of attributes for self-registration
and depended on Scrutor itself, but has evolved into a complete replacement for most scenarios.

You can access the [Registerly documentation](https://manuel-fernandez-rodriguez.github.io/DeviantCoding/docs/registerly/introduction.html) and give it a try.
