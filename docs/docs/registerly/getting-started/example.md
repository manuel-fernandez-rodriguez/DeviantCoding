# Working Example
This is a small minimal WebApi showing how to register classes by attributes and by selecting them.

Create a new WebApi project, add a reference to `DeviantCoding.Registerly` and copy paste this code in a Program.cs:

[!code-csharp[](../samples/Registerly.Samples.WebApi/Program.cs)]
