# DeviantCoding.

DeviantCoding aims to group a set of opinionated components sharing a common code style and build tools.

## Registerly

This is the first and, for now, only component using the framework. 
It started as an improvement on [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor)'s handling of attributes for self-registration, which, actually, 
depended on Scrutor itself, but has evolved into a complete replacement for Scrutor.

You can access the [Registerly documentation](docs/registerly/introduction.md) and give it a try.
